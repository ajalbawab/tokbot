# tokbot
Hey now, if robot's can have fake accounts so can we?

This is a simple looping robot that simulates engagement on TikTok. It scrapes proxies and uses the chrome browser with those proxies to simulate different IP Addresses and minimize tracking redundancy.

This code IS flexible and can be used in multi-threading.
